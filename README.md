# Features

This software accompanies the physical CamHolder you can find at http://CamHolder.org and runs on Mac OSX 10.6+. It connects to one or more USB WebCams of the type "Microsoft LifeCam Studio" and offers several features such as

 - zooming and rotation,
 - fullscreen and snap to center (for screencasting),
 - manual exposure time and focus,
 - borderless and resizable windows,
 - comfortable keyboard short cuts,

that make presenting and screencasting with the CamHolder a snap.
